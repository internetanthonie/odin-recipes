    <p> <H2>Descrption</H2></p>
    <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>

    <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>White Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
        
        <P><H2>Steps</H2></P>

        <ul>
            <ul>Step 1</ul>
        
        In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.
        
        <ul>Step 2</ul>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. </ul>
